# Kalamazoo College Mathematics Website
* This website will serve as a homepage for the mathematics department.
* The primary focus of the project will be implementing a “problem system” for practicing mathematics problems, puzzles, and proofs

# Goals for this Project
1. Offer a place for students who participate in **MatheliKs (Math Club)** to practice, and have access to, competition problems
2. Using the same system, offer course content for:
	1. **Calc I: Limits and Differentiation**
	2. **Calc II: Integration, Sequences, and Series**
	3. **Calc III: High Dimensional / Vector Calculus**

# Setup Process
## Requirements
* This website currently runs using a `MERN` stack and manages packages through `npm`, thus the appropriate technologies are required.
## Installation
* To install packages simply type `npm install` in the application directory = `kzoomath`
## Starting the Web Server
* To start the web server and display the website just type `npm start` in the application directory = `kzoomath`
